# NAME RESOLUTION
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every MSHSAA team link contains a permanent numeric school ID in its href:
#   e.g. /MySchool/Schedule.aspx?s=257
# This ID never changes even when MSHSAA renames or merges a school.
#
# Resolution order for each scraped team:
#   1. Extract the s= ID from the href
#   2. Look the ID up in id_to_classname (built by exact-matching
#      mshsaa_schools.csv names against classifications.json)
#      → If found, use the classification name. Done.
#   3. If the ID is not in the map, check whether the raw display text
#      from the page exactly matches a name in classifications.json
#      → If found, use it. Done.
#   4. If neither resolves, return None — the game will be skipped.
#
# This handles "Scott City with Chaffee" correctly:
#   - MSHSAA shows "Scott City with Chaffee" as display text today
#   - But the href still has Scott City's original s= ID
#   - That ID maps to "Scott City" in our lookup
#   - Game is correctly attributed to Scott City with no manual work
#
# No fuzzy matching is used anywhere. Fuzzy matching caused silent wrong
# attributions (e.g. "Scott City" silently mapped to "Seneca").
